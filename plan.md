# Trailer Rental App Implementation Plan

This plan details the step-by-step changes across the codebase to implement a trailer rental app with two user types (trailer owners and customers), a booking system, trailer management, and client-side Apple Sign-In. The itsme and European Driving License verification systems will remain disabled (with placeholders), and their configurations documented via environment variables.

---

## 1. Environment and README Updates
- **README.md**
  - Add a section on environment variables:
    - Example variables:  
      `APPLE_CLIENT_ID=your_apple_client_id`
    - Note: itsme and European Driving License Verification are disabled (placeholders for future integration).
  - Document local setup and API usage (client-side Apple Sign-In, simulated booking, and trailer management).
- **.env.local (new file, not in VCS)**
  - Include environment configurations for Apple authentication.

---

## 2. Next.js Configuration
- **next.config.ts**
  - Ensure environment variables are exposed as needed (if using runtime config, add process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_ID).

---

## 3. Authentication with Apple (Client-Side)
- **File: src/context/AuthContext.tsx**
  - Create an AuthContext provider to manage and share the user's authentication state.
  - Handle collection of user details (name, email) upon successful Apple Sign-In.
- **File: src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
  - Implement a custom hook that consumes AuthContext to allow components to access authentication state.
- **File: src/components/Auth/AppleSignInButton.tsx**
  - Create a functional component that renders a modern, styled button with clear typography.
  - On click, simulate the Apple sign-in flow (redirect to Apple’s authentication endpoint using the CLIENT_ID from environment variables).
  - Handle successful login by storing user details in AuthContext.
  - Include error handling (e.g., display an error message if sign-in fails).

---

## 4. Main Landing and Login Pages
- **File: src/app/page.tsx**
  - Build a clean landing page with a modern layout (ample spacing, elegant typography).
  - Place a prominent “Sign in with Apple” button (using AppleSignInButton) and navigation links.
  - Use a grid/flex layout to guide users into the login flow or allow browsing trailers.
- *(Optional)* **File: src/app/auth/login.tsx**
  - If a separate login page is needed, replicate the landing page’s authentication section here.

---

## 5. Customer Booking System
- **File: src/components/Booking/BookingForm.tsx**
  - Create a booking form with fields:
    - Date range picker for booking dates (integrate the pre-built calendar component from src/components/ui/calendar.tsx).
    - Input fields for pickup and delivery locations (use ui/input.tsx, ui/label.tsx).
    - Pricing details: automatically compute non-refundable per-day cost and refundable deposit.
  - Include client-side validation and error messages.
- **File: src/app/customer/bookings.tsx**
  - Create a customer dashboard page that imports and displays BookingForm.
  - Add sections for active/past booking history.
  - Use a modern layout ensuring clear hierarchy through styling.

---

## 6. Trailer Owner Management
- **File: src/components/TrailerManagement/TrailerRequestCard.tsx**
  - Develop a card component that displays a trailer booking request’s details.
  - Include two buttons: “Approve” and “Deny” with confirm dialogs (use ui/dialog.tsx).
  - Implement basic error handling if the action is not permitted.
- **File: src/app/owner/dashboard.tsx**
  - Create a dashboard page for trailer owners that:
    - Displays a list of incoming trailer requests using multiple TrailerRequestCard components.
    - Allows filtering/sorting based on status.
    - Shows basic analytics (e.g., number of pending requests) if necessary.
  
---

## 7. API Endpoints & Data Handling
- **File: src/app/api/trailer-request/route.ts**
  - Implement a POST endpoint for customers to create new trailer booking requests.
  - Validate the request body (dates, locations, pricing) and return appropriate error statuses.
- **File: src/app/api/trailer-request/[id]/route.ts**
  - Implement PUT/DELETE endpoints for trailer owners to update booking status (approve/deny).
  - Use try–catch blocks to handle errors and send clear HTTP error responses.
- **File: src/lib/db.ts**
  - Create a simulated in-memory database or stub functions to store/retrieve booking and trailer request data.
  - This abstraction allows easy migration to a real database later.
- **File: src/lib/utils.ts**
  - Add utility functions (e.g., date formatting and price calculations) to support booking and dashboard operations.

---

## 8. UI/UX and Styling
- **File: src/app/globals.css**
  - Update global CSS with modern typography, spacing, and color palette.
  - Ensure responsiveness with media queries and a flexible grid system.
- **Additional UI Components**
  - Optionally create a navigation bar component (e.g., src/components/Navbar.tsx) for easy user switching between customer and owner views.
  - Use consistent styling across buttons, forms, and dialogs without referencing external icon libraries.

---

## Summary
- The plan updates the README and environment files for Apple authentication and placeholder integrations.  
- The Next.js configuration is adjusted for environment variables.  
- Client-side Apple Sign-In is implemented via an AuthContext, custom hook, and a dedicated AppleSignInButton component.  
- A modern landing page is built in src/app/page.tsx, with separate booking and dashboard pages for customers and trailer owners.  
- UI components for booking forms and trailer request management are created using existing shadcn/ui elements.  
- API endpoints and a simulated database using /src/lib/db.ts ensure proper backend functionality with robust error handling.
